It is the first NASA high priority science mission launched by SpaceX. It was the first time SpaceX launched a scientific satellite not primarily intended for Earth observations. The second stage placed it into a high-Earth elliptical orbit, after which the satellite's own booster will perform complex maneuvers including a lunar flyby, and over the course of two months, reach a stable, 2:1 resonant orbit with the Moon. In January 2018, SpaceX received NASA's Launch Services Program Category 2 certification of its Falcon 9 'Full Thrust', certification which is required for launching medium risk missions like TESS. It was the last launch of a new Block 4 booster, and marked the 24th successful recovery of the booster. An experimental water landing was performed in order to attempt fairing recovery.","upcoming":false,"static_fire_date_utc":"2018-04-11T18:30:00.000Z","static_fire_date_unix":1523471400,"timeline":{"webcast_liftoff":1195,"go_for_prop_loading":-2280,"rp1_loading":-2100,"stage1_lox_loading":-2100,"stage2_lox_loading":-960,"engine_chill":-420,"prelaunch_checks":-60,"propellant_pressurization":-60,"go_for_launch":-45,"ignition":-3,"liftoff":0,"maxq":76,"meco":149,"stage_sep":152,"second_stage_ignition":159,"fairing_deploy":181,"first_stage_entry_burn":389,"first_stage_landing":476,"seco-1":500,"second_stage_restart":2590,"seco-2":2643,"payload_deploy":2975},"crew":null}]
